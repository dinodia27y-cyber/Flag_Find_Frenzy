# Flag-Find Frenzy

Flag-Find Frenzy is a desktop quiz built with Tkinter. Pick a difficulty mode, view each flag, and try to pick the correct country before seeing its fun fact.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Tkinter (ships with most Python installations)

## Usage

From the project folder:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

1. Type the mode you want (`all`, `easy`, `standard`, `advanced`, `expert`) on the start screen.
2. Press **Start** to begin the quiz.
3. Click the correct country for each flag. After every guess, read the fun fact, then hit **Next Question**.
4. Check your final score and click **Play Again** to run another mode.

All flag images live under `data/`, and the matching facts live under `facts/` (using the same two-letter file codes such as `US`, `IN`, `JP`, etc.).
